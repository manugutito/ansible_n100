# ansible_n100
Toy ansible playbook for home server. Not useful for anyone but here I have a place to pull from. Feel free to look but there's much better places to check out.

To use it, I typically run

```
ansible-playbook -Ki inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

-i is to indicate the inventory file and -K is to get prompted for the sudo password to elevate privileges.

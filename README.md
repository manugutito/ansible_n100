# ansible_n100
Toy ansible playbook for home server. Not useful for anyone but here I have a place to pull from. Feel free to look but there's much better places to check out.

My sources (not exhaustive, I have anyway not check out the sources fully):
 - Jeff Geerling's [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/)
 - Jeff Geerling's [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling)
 - A nonending series of random webpages
